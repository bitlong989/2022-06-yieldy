Could you please explain how Cow Protocol is used within Yieldy? Thanks!


[06/23/2022 11:12 AM] ak19966
The second way we solved this problem was to implement Curve and trade directly from the yieldy token to the staking asset. This will work for assets that have liquidity for their yieldy counterpart on Curve, but if not, we have the LiquidityReserve to fall back on.


[06/23/2022 11:13 AM] ak19966
I am wondering what sort of benifit can user get because of this.. can you pls put some more lights on this


[06/23/2022 12:01 PM] 0xean
Yup, cowswap can used to swap TOKE rewards to the staking token

[06/23/2022 12:04 PM] 0xean
Let's talk about FOX as an example token.  Currently if you stake for FOX, and then want to unstake your fox, you have a 7-14 day window in which that FOX will become claimable due to tokemak's cycles.  So you lose the ability to get immediate liquidity if you need it.

The LiquidityReserve allows a user to instant unstake and avoid this cool down period for a fee. Alternatively, if the staking token and the tAsset (from tokemak) have a curve pool we can allow the user to swap there for immediate liquidity instead.


[06/23/2022 12:13 PM] ak19966
However user should have reserve in the liquidity.. then only they can unstake it before maturity.. if user has reserve they are going to use it .. then why they want to go for unstake


[06/23/2022 12:14 PM] m4rio.eth
hey, `ITokePool` it's what contract?


[06/23/2022 12:14 PM] m4rio.eth
as it's not in the scope but would love to see what requestedWithdrawals does


[06/23/2022 12:24 PM] 0xean
I am not sure I understand your question, can you rephrase it maybe?


[06/23/2022 12:24 PM] 0xean
yea, thats from tokemak, let me see if I can find a link.

I believe this is it, but lets get @Toshi  to confirm as the author of these smart contracts.

[06/23/2022 12:25 PM] m4rio.eth
awesome, thank you


[06/23/2022 12:26 PM] ak19966
If user want to unstake then they have to use the token from reserve and go for unstakking. In what way it could be benifit them.. ?


[06/23/2022 12:28 PM] 0xean
In the "normal" flow,  a user has to wait 7-14 days to unstake
In the liquidity reserve flow, a user can unstake immediately.


[06/23/2022 12:28 PM] 0xean
the benefit is immediate liquidity


[06/23/2022 1:02 PM] ak19966
But.. user is going to use the asset from liquidity right..


[06/23/2022 1:02 PM] ak19966
Even can they withdraw from liquidity reseve?


[06/23/2022 1:08 PM] 0xean
hmmm, I still dont understand what you mean here.

Real world example.  

A user stakes FOX and gets FOXy, later they want immediate liquidity and cannot wait 7-14 days. They call instantUnstake and swap their FOXy for FOX (less a fee).


[06/23/2022 1:23 PM] Toshi#4576
Correct! This is the  ITokePool contract


[06/23/2022 1:36 PM] ak19966
Got it... Tnq


[06/23/2022 1:57 PM] m4rio.eth
Hey,
another question:
who sets the epoch time on the Staking contract?


[06/23/2022 3:15 PM] Toshi#4576
The owner of the contracts set it


[06/23/2022 5:35 PM] m4rio.eth
another question: 
who is IStaking from the migrator?


[06/23/2022 5:35 PM] m4rio.eth
it's an old staking contract?


[06/23/2022 5:58 PM] 0xean
yes, that is correct.... the existing staking contract for FOX(y)


[06/23/2022 5:58 PM] 0xean
we will eventually migrate holders of FOXy to the new contracts


[06/23/2022 6:07 PM] m4rio.eth
can i get that contract as well? so we can see how it behaves?


[06/23/2022 8:19 PM] Toshi#4576
here is the current staking contract

What does "WAD" stand for??


[06/24/2022 7:44 AM] 0x1f8b
`Staking.sol` is IStaking or IStakingV1 ?


[06/24/2022 8:20 AM] 0xleastwood
`wad` just represents a number with 18 decimals


[06/24/2022 8:23 AM] tchkvsky
Thanks @0xleastwood. I saw the declaration. I was just thinking if it was an acronym for sth


[06/24/2022 8:26 AM] 0xleastwood
AFAIK, I don't think it is an acronym for anything. I could be wrong though. Dapp-tools came up with the term, so it could be documented somewhere by them.


[06/24/2022 8:28 AM] tchkvsky
Ah. Thanks for clearing that up

Have I got these right?

`TOKE_TOKEN`:  The reward token you get during staking `STAKING_TOKEN` in the `TOKE_POOL`.
`TOKE_POOL`: The address where you deposit `STAKING_TOKEN` to earn `TOKE_TOKEN`. It is also a receipt token representing the `STAKING_TOKEN`.
`TOKE_MANAGER`: An address that provides view functions regarding `TOKE_POOL` information.
`TOKE_REWARD`: A separate contract you use to claim `TOKE_TOKEN` rewards that were earned by staking to `TOKE_POOL`.
`CURVE_POOL`: A Curve pool whose pair tokens are `TOKE_POOL` and `STAKING_TOKEN`
`COW_SETTLEMENT`: A contract that instructs `COW_RELAYER` to swap `TOKE_TOKEN` for `STAKING_TOKEN`
`COW_RELAYER`: A contract that swaps `TOKE_TOKEN` for `STAKING_TOKEN`

"The owner of these contracts will be the ShapeShift DAO's multisig. "

Does this mean that the onlyOwner modifier points to a multisig? for example in staking.sol.


[06/25/2022 5:31 AM] Toshi#4576
Correct


[06/25/2022 11:54 AM] elku.cryptos
the scope is limited to just the 5 contracts mentioned here right?
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-yieldy#smart-contracts


[06/25/2022 12:11 PM] illilli000
are the owner dao operations behind a timelock?


[06/25/2022 2:03 PM] 0xean
They are DAO operations, no timelock in place currently.  The DAO has a ~3 week ish governance process at a minimum, but I think calling out the lack of timelock is fair game.

[06/26/2022 7:12 AM] 0x1f8b
it is beginning to become a common practice to extend the contests, and some of us adjust to the established time.  I personally believe that it should only be done if a large majority asks for it, or at the beginning.

QA and Gas reports are one report only, so no, they won't have more time if they've already submitted


[06/26/2022 9:15 AM] illilli000
and something where you've found a low/medium, but didn't have enough time to dig into deeper layers to potentially find that it's actually a high, and submitted anyway, is another case where it's unfair. Also, not everyone monitors discord, and they won't see the change in time
